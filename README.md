# Java 9 Module Demo

A failed attempt to subvert the Java 9 module loading system.

Inside each folder, execute the following commands to build and run:

```sh
./compile.sh
./package.sh
./run.sh
```

If the execution was completely successful, the output will be:

```
Service B: Module D:1.0
Service C: Module D:2.0
```

Failure to build, package, or run may be expected.
